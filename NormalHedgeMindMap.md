# NormalHedge


## 1) Introduction

### DTOL

### The potential game

### equivalence between DTOL algorithms and the potential game

### Results for extended game

- A min-max algorithm for known horizon

- An anytime algorithm (NormalHedge)

- Interpretation of the limit game.

## Equivalence of potential game and DTOL game

## The extended game

Use adversarial strategy as justification.

## Backwards recursion

## The adversary prefers small steps

## The small step limit and Kolmogorov Backwards Equation

## The bounds

### Known horizon

### Normal-Hedge

## Interpretation of the continuous time limit and application to stock market trading.
